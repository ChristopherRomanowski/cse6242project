DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is the top level directory containing all of the source code used in this project for
scraping data and generating models. Each subdirectory can be considered it's own module, and they
each have their own README that contains their description and installation/execution guide. 

The directory `profootballapi-scraper` is the only directory containing code for scraping data.
Running the code in this directory is not necessary to make the code in any other directories work.
All other directories are models we created to evaluate the data and generate the results. Each
model directory is self-contained.

INSTALLATION
